## Introduction

I’m an experienced POS consultant pivoting into professional software development through CNM Ingenuity’s AI‑Enhanced Software Development (Java & Kotlin) bootcamp. With a background in designing and implementing end‑to‑end business systems, I’m focused on mastering Java, Kotlin, Android, and modern tooling so I can build robust, real‑world applications that integrate cleanly with the kinds of operational platforms I’ve supported for years.
